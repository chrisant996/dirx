# FEATURES

### BUGS

### Next
- Write README.md file as documentation.
- Document the `--nix` flag once it's more polished (also find a better name?).

### Git integration
- Git status column for files.  Be very careful about performance!

### Back burner
- Default colors.  Maybe a few different preset options; basic, attributes, file types?
- Tree view?  The vertical extender lines can be tracked with a "more" bit per directory component.
- Post-process column computation to reduce rows by shifting items into a new column?  `ls` does not, but `eza` does.

### Future; maybe
- Configurable icon mappings?
- Option to show column headers?
