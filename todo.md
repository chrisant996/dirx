# FEATURES

### BUGS

### Rethink and simplify
- Be more user friendly like eza.
- Built in date formats like eza (since they're mostly ISO based).
- Add an "overlay" color style for `readme*` files, instead of being hard-coded.
- Messy:  `-Z --no-size` and `--size -Z-` don't have an intuitive outcome.
- Move `-E` to `--ellipsis-char`.

### Git integration
- Ignore files per `.gitignore`.
- Git status column for files.  Be very careful about performance!

### Maybe
- Something like `%EZA_GRID_ROWS%`?
- Ability to choose which file attributes to list, without needing to use format pictures?
- Attribute colors?
- Combine "d" and "l" attributes into same column?
- Configurable icon mappings?
- Tree view?  The vertical extender lines can be tracked with a "more" bit per directory component.
- Option to show column headers?  Format pictures make it difficult.
