# FEATURES

### BUGS

### Back burner
- Debugging output.
- Default colors.  Maybe a few different preset options; basic, attributes, file types?
- Tree view?  The vertical extender lines can be tracked with a "more" bit per directory component.
- Unit tests.

### Future; maybe
- Configurable icon mappings?
- Option to show column headers?
- Post-process column computation to reduce rows by shifting items into a new column?  `ls` does not, but `eza` does.  I'm not sure I like the effect on the list; it makes it easy to lose track of the final column since it can end up having only a few files instead of at least ((N/COLS)-COLS) files.
